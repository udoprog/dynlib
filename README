I needed this type of library for a parser I was writing.
Focus is on:
  - Memory detention, 0% memory loss (since all objects are allocated in the same space).
  - Simple, yet dynamic allocation.

Install libdyn (default PREFIX=/usr/local, which means you must be root or priviliged)

make install

Compile Example 1:

make ex1

then run it:

./example1

And please... test it for memory leaks

valgrind ./example1

And so on for example[1-4]
